# Powerful-possum

## Powerful possum” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.
Idea stolen from [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/).
